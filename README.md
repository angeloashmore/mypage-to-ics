# mypage-to-ics
Import a MyPage schedule to your calendar via ICS.

## Installation

Add `bookmarklet.js` as a bookmark:

1. View [bookmarklet.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angeloashmore/mypage-to-ics/master/bookmarklet.js).
2. Select all (âŒ˜+A) and drag the contents to your bookmarks bar.
3. Rename it to something useful (e.g. "Import Schedule").

**Note**: This has only been tested with Safari on OS X and iOS.

## Known Issues

* **Safari on iOS displays "Download Failed" message.**
  
  Ignore this message; this does not affect importing the schedule. Safari on iOS has strict file management.

If you encounter any other issue, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/angeloashmore/mypage-to-ics/issues) with a description.
