# mypage-to-ics
Import an Apple MyPage schedule to your calendar via ICS.

## Installation

Add `bookmarklet.js` as a bookmark:

1. View [bookmarklet.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angeloashmore/mypage-to-ics/master/bookmarklet.js).
2. Select all (âŒ˜+A) and drag the contents to your bookmarks bar.
3. Rename it to something useful (e.g. "Import Schedule").

**Note**: This has only been tested with Safari on OS X and iOS.

## Known Issues

* **Safari on iOS displays "Download Failed" message.**

  Ignore this message; this does not affect importing the schedule. Safari on iOS has strict file management.

* **Safari on OS X downloads an "Unknown" file.**

  Add `.ics` to the end of the filename. You should then be able to open it and import your schedule to Calendar.
